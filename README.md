Implementation of an accumulator computer system  with a 16-bit cell memory.




# Summary
implementation of an accumulator computer system with a 16-bit cell memory. The computer system operates with synchronous memory

# Specifications
 This project focuses on the design and implementation of an accumulator computer system with a 16-bit cell memory. The computer system operates with synchronous memory, where the CPU can read or write one cell within a single clock cycle. The primary means of accessing the memory is through the memory address register (MAR) and the memory buffer register (MBR). The objective of this project is to develop a functional and efficient accumulator computer architecture. The system utilizes a synchronous memory model to ensure precise and controlled memory access. The design considerations include optimizing the efficiency of memory operations while maintaining data integrity.
